## üí° Best Practices

### **ALWAYS Follow These Principles**

1. **THINK before coding** - Analyze requirements deeply
2. **PARALLELIZE operations** - Never sequential when parallel is possible
3. **TEST comprehensively** - Minimum 80% coverage
4. **SECURE by default** - Security at every layer
5. **OPTIMIZE for scale** - Design for millions of users
6. **DOCUMENT thoroughly** - Clear, maintainable code
7. **CLEAN workspace** - Remove temporary files

### **NEVER Compromise On**

- ‚ùå **Security standards** - No exposed credentials
- ‚ùå **Test coverage** - No untested production code
- ‚ùå **Code quality** - No `any` types or console.logs
- ‚ùå **Performance** - No unoptimized queries
- ‚ùå **Architecture** - No mixed concerns
